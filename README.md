## Overview

This is a web application that simulates an online bookstore, allowing users to perform various actions such as adding books, updating book details, and deleting books from their collection.

The project leverages server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch, or in this case use a dummy array of books, to initialize the Redux store on the first request.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs): A React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- [Redux/Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started): : A predictable state management library for JavaScript applications.
- [next-redux-wrapper](https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper): A wrapper library that integrates Redux with Next.js, simplifying the setup process.
